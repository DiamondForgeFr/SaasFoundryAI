# AI Rules

The workflow is only useful if the AI agent follows it. These are the **non-negotiable rules** that the `sf-workflow` skill enforces on every ticket.

Violating these rules is not a style choice — it's a bug in the agent's behaviour. If you catch the agent bypassing any of these, correct it immediately and investigate why the guardrail failed.

## 1. Always read the status description before acting

Before every workflow action — transitioning status, creating a branch, running tests, opening a PR — the agent reads `.claude/skills/sf-workflow/statuses/<N>-<name>.md` to pull the mandatory actions
and exit conditions for the current status.

**Why:** status descriptions are the source of truth. They encode gating logic, ordering requirements, and edge cases that the conversation context cannot be trusted to preserve across long sessions.

**How to apply:** when in doubt, re-run `.claude/skills/sf-workflow/workflow-cli.sh status <ticket>` and re-read the file. Never guess.

## 2. Follow the configured route; never invent a shortcut

The ordered statuses come from `.saasfoundry.json`. The team preset uses seven and the solo preset uses five; both install matching status documents and guards. A custom template may store another
sequence, but the team must add the corresponding documents and guard logic before an agent can safely follow it.

**Common violations to watch for:**

- applying the team sequence to a project configured with `solo`;
- skipping AI testing because a change looks small;
- treating team `Human testing` as code review instead of functional feature testing;
- moving team `Human testing` directly to Done instead of readying the PR for code review;
- moving any delivery ticket to Done without the merge evidence its nature requires.

**Why:** every configured gate catches a class of failure. The team preset separates feature testing from code review; the solo preset intentionally combines its human gate with PR review. Complexity
changes the rigor _inside_ those phases, while nature-controlled routes handle internal work, bundled children and Epics.

**How to apply:** run `workflow-cli.sh status <ticket>`, read the manifest sequence and current status document, then use the guarded transition. Never reconstruct a workflow from memory.

## 3. Never bypass the workflow CLI

Every status transition, every subtask creation, every board update goes through `workflow-cli.sh` and the tool-specific CLI (e.g. `github-projects-cli.sh`). The agent does not run raw
`gh api graphql` mutations, does not hand-edit labels, does not touch the project board directly.

**Why:** the CLI layer encapsulates multi-step logic (e.g. "set complexity" removes the old complexity label before adding the new one; "create subtask" creates the issue _and_ links it via the
GraphQL `addSubIssue` mutation in one atomic step). Bypassing it leaves the board in an inconsistent state.

**How to apply:** if the agent wants to do something the CLI doesn't support, the fix is to **extend the CLI**, not to bypass it.

## 4. Commit and push before AI testing

The code being tested must be on the remote. Period.

**Why:** "AI testing" is an automated validation phase that must be reproducible. If the code only exists locally, CI cannot run, the developer cannot inspect it, and the test plan cannot be validated
against a consistent state.

**How to apply:** the last action of "In progress" is `git push`. Only then does the agent request the transition to AI testing. If the agent tries to transition without pushing, the gate check fails.

## 5. Child tickets are native GitHub sub-issues

When an In-progress ticket needs decomposition, child tickets are created as **native GitHub sub-issues linked via the sub-issue relationship** — not as markdown checkboxes in the parent. A normal
child owns its own branch and PR. A bundled child carries `nature:bundled-pr`, contributes one atomic commit on the delivery parent's branch, and has no individual PR.

**Why:** checkboxes are cosmetic — they don't show up in search, assignees can't be tracked, they don't block parent transitions, and they disappear if someone edits the parent body. Real sub-issues
participate in the board, respect complexity labels independently, and are visible in the parent's delivery state.

**How to apply:** use `github-projects-cli.sh create-subtask <parent> "<title>"`. The CLI handles the GraphQL `addSubIssue` mutation. Never create subtasks with raw `gh issue create`.

## 6. Close child tickets as they are delivered

After a normal child's PR is verified merged, or a bundled child's atomic commit is validated on the delivery parent's branch, **immediately** close the corresponding issue — don't batch closures at
the end of the parent ticket.

**Why:** the board state must reflect reality at all times. Merging code while leaving the subtask open creates an inconsistent state: the code is done, the board says it isn't. When the parent
transitions to Done, the child-status gate fails and the agent has to context-switch back to close every child at once — losing the link between each closure and its delivery.

**How to apply:** run `workflow-cli.sh update-status <child> Done` after the child's delivery is verified and confirm `gh issue view <child> --json state` prints `CLOSED` before moving to the next
child.

## 7. Gate parent Done on child completion

Before moving a parent to `Done`, inspect every native child ticket and verify that each is already `Done`:

```bash
.claude/skills/sf-tool-github-projects/github-projects-cli.sh list-incomplete-children <N>
```

The command uses GitHub's native sub-issue relationship and returns every child whose project-board Status is not exactly `Done`. Any child in Backlog, Ready, In progress, AI testing, Human testing,
In review, or an unknown status blocks the parent. Incomplete children do not block AI Testing, Human Testing, or In Review.

**Why:** same invariant as rule 6, enforced at transition time as a last-resort check. Catches cases where rule 6 was accidentally violated.

**How to apply:** the status description for `7-done.md` requires this check before the transition. The agent never skips it.

## 8. Finish the current ticket before starting another

If a ticket is in `In progress` / `AI testing` / `Human testing` / `In review`, drive it to Done before claiming or starting another.

**Why:** context-switching between tickets multiplies the risk of bypassing rules 4–7. The agent loses track of which branch to commit to, which subtasks to close, which test plan to run. The only
sure way to avoid cross-contamination is to fully close one ticket before opening another.

**How to apply:** the only override is an **explicit developer request to pause** the current ticket. The agent doesn't self-authorise a pause.

## Why these rules are not negotiable

The SaaSFoundryAI workflow is dogfooded: the same rules that govern how we build SaaSFoundryAI are the rules that govern how our users build their projects. Every bug in our workflow ships to every
user. Every shortcut we take is a shortcut users will inherit.

The rules exist because we have already felt the pain of each one being violated:

- Rule 4 came from a session where we ran AI testing on local code that was never pushed — the test plan validated nothing.
- Rules 5–7 came from a parent-child inconsistency that left child tickets open after the parent was marked Done.
- Rule 8 came from multiple incidents where a half-done ticket bled into a new one and corrupted both branches.

If you catch the agent violating any of these, the correct response is to reset to the last known-good state and restart the phase — not to paper over the violation.
