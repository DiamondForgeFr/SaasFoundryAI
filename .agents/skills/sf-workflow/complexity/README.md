# Complexity-Based Adaptive Workflow

This directory contains complexity configurations that adapt the workflow process based on ticket complexity.

## Complexity Levels

| Level       | Label      | Style              | Use Case                               |
| ----------- | ---------- | ------------------ | -------------------------------------- |
| **bug**     | 🐛 Bug Fix | Direct fix         | Quick bug fixes, minimal ceremony      |
| **low**     | 🟢 Low     | Oneshot            | Simple tasks, fast iteration           |
| **medium**  | 🟡 Medium  | Structured         | Standard features, structured approach |
| **complex** | 🔴 Complex | Deep + adversarial | Critical features, adversarial review  |

## How It Works

### 1. Complexity Detection

When a ticket enters Backlog, the AI suggests a complexity level based on:

- Number of files potentially impacted
- Keywords in description (auth, payment, security → complex)
- Risk assessment
- Historical similar tickets

**Developer always has final say on complexity tag.**

### 2. Adaptive Steps

Each complexity level enables/disables workflow steps:

#### Bug (🐛)

- Skip: Backlog (direct to In Progress)
- Skip: Analyze, Plan
- Execute: Direct fix
- Validate: Build + lint + regression test
- Skip: Examine
- Tests: Regression test only

#### Low (🟢)

- Analyze: Minimal (2-3 files, no agents)
- Plan: Mental plan only
- Execute: Direct implementation
- Validate: Lint + typecheck
- Skip: Examine
- Tests: Optional

#### Medium (🟡)

- Analyze: Standard (2-4 agents)
- Plan: Detailed file-by-file (requires approval)
- Execute: Subtasks mandatory
- Validate: Build + lint + typecheck + unit tests
- Skip: Examine
- Tests: Unit + E2E recommended

#### Complex (🔴)

- Analyze: Deep (6-10 agents)
- Plan: Comprehensive with dependencies (requires approval)
- Execute: Granular subtasks mandatory
- Validate: Full test suite
- **Examine: Adversarial review (security, logic, performance)**
- Tests: Unit + E2E + regression mandatory (80% coverage)

### 3. Configuration Format

Each `.yml` file contains:

```yaml
name: complexity-level
label: "Display label"
description: "Description"

skipStatuses: []  # Which statuses can be skipped

steps:
  analyze:
    enabled: boolean
    depth: "minimal" | "standard" | "deep"
    agents: number  # 0-10
  plan:
    enabled: boolean
    depth: "minimal" | "detailed" | "comprehensive"
    approval: boolean
  subtasks:
    enabled: boolean
    mandatory: boolean
  examine:
    enabled: boolean
  tests:
    type: "optional" | "recommended" | "mandatory"
    mandatory: boolean

testing:
  unit: boolean
  e2e: boolean
  regression: boolean
  coverage: number | null

## Schema

The format above is the summary; this section is the reference. A profile is one file, `complexity/<name>.yml`, where `<name>` is the value of the ticket label `complexity: <name>` and equals the
`name` key.

Two kinds of keys exist, and the difference matters when you edit one:

- **Script-read** keys are parsed by a shell script. Their exact spelling, indentation and position count (see [How the scripts read a profile](#how-the-scripts-read-a-profile)).
- **Agent-read** keys are read by the coding agent when it opens the file (the `prepare` and `test` commands tell it to follow the profile). No script reads them. Changing one changes the guidance the
  agent works from, not the behaviour of any guard.

"Required" means every shipped profile sets the key and the scripts or the agent expect it; nothing validates a profile against a schema, so a missing key fails silently (an empty value in a script,
or a gap in the agent's guidance).

### How the scripts read a profile

The scripts do not parse YAML. `analyze.sh` and `plan.sh` read one key of one step block with a small `awk` function, `step_value`:

```bash
# scripts/analyze.sh (plan.sh reads the "plan" block the same way)
ANALYZE_ENABLED=$(step_value "$CONFIG_FILE" analyze enabled)
```

The block starts at its two-space header and ends at the next two-space header or top-level key, so a key is never read from a neighbouring block.

Consequences to respect when editing:

- The block header must be indented exactly two spaces (`  analyze:`, `  plan:`), under `steps:`.
- The keys are indented four spaces under their header and matched by name; the value is the second whitespace-separated token of the line, with its quotes removed. Write scalar values without spaces;
  a trailing `# comment` is fine.
- `description` stays on one line, in double or single quotes, for `detect-complexity.sh`. Either style works, so a formatter that rewrites the quotes (Prettier does this to YAML) changes nothing.

### Where the level names are fixed

The four level names are not discovered from the directory. They are repeated in code, so a new file in `complexity/` is not picked up on its own:

| Place                                                                      | What it fixes                                                                                        |
| -------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `github-projects-cli.sh` `set-complexity` and `create-ticket --complexity` | The accepted values (`bug`, `low`, `medium`, `complex`). `retag` goes through this command.          |
| `workflow-cli.sh` complexity guard and the `sync-pr-review` label check    | The label values the guards recognise.                                                               |
| `scripts/analyze.sh`, `scripts/plan.sh`                                    | A `case` per level holding the long-form guidance text; any other level prints "Unknown complexity". |
| `scripts/detect-complexity.sh`                                             | The keyword scoring and the score thresholds that choose `bug`, `low`, `medium` or `complex`.        |
| `workflow-cli.sh test`                                                     | Adversarial review is tied to the literal level `complex`.                                           |

## Annotated example

`medium.yml`, with each key annotated by who reads it:

```yaml
name: medium # agent: must equal the file name and the label suffix
label: '🟡 Medium Complexity' # agent: display only
description: 'Standard feature with structured analysis and planning' # detect-complexity.sh: one line, either quote style

skipStatuses: [] # agent: no status may be skipped

steps:
  analyze:
    enabled: true # analyze.sh
    depth: 'standard' # analyze.sh
    agents: 3 # analyze.sh: 2-4 parallel agents
    agentTypes: # agent
      - explore-codebase
      - explore-docs # if the library is unfamiliar
  plan:
    enabled: true # plan.sh
    depth: 'detailed' # plan.sh: file-by-file plan
    approval: true # plan.sh: the user approves before implementation
  subtasks:
    enabled: true # agent: split into real subtask tickets
    mandatory: true # agent
  examine:
    enabled: false # agent: no adversarial review at this level
  tests:
    type: 'recommended' # agent
    mandatory: false # agent: recommended, not forced

testing:
  unit: true # agent: unit tests for business logic
  e2e: true # agent: end-to-end for user workflows
  regression: true # agent
  coverage: null # agent: no numeric target

aiInstructions: | # agent: one paragraph per phase
  This is a medium-complexity feature. Use a structured approach:

  **Analyze Phase (STANDARD):**
  - Launch 2-4 parallel exploration agents
  ...
```

The other three profiles follow the same shape. What sets them apart is which steps are on: `bug` turns analyze, plan, subtasks and examine off and keeps a mandatory regression test; `low` keeps a
minimal analyze and plan without approval; `complex` adds mandatory approval, mandatory granular subtasks, the adversarial review (3 agents, three checks) and an 80% coverage target.

## Adding or changing a profile

**Changing the behaviour of an existing level** (the common case): edit its `.yml`.

1. Edit only the values; keep the structure, the two-space indentation of `analyze:` and `plan:`, and the one-line quoted `description`.
2. Mirror the change in the "Adaptive Steps" summary above, and in `aiInstructions` when the agent's guidance changes.
3. Check what the scripts read: `bash scripts/analyze.sh 0 <level>` and `bash scripts/plan.sh 0 <level>` print the values they extracted.
4. The profiles are part of the installed skill: a skill refresh can overwrite a local edit, so keep project-specific changes under review in version control.

**Adding a new level** needs more than a new file, because the names are fixed in code (see the table above):

1. Create `complexity/<name>.yml` from the closest existing profile.
2. Add the name to the accepted values in `set-complexity` and `create-ticket --complexity` (`github-projects-cli.sh`), and to the label checks in `workflow-cli.sh`.
3. Add a `case` branch to `scripts/analyze.sh` and `scripts/plan.sh`, and a score range to `scripts/detect-complexity.sh` if it should be suggested automatically.
4. Create the `complexity: <name>` label on the board repository, document the level in the tables of this file and of `SKILL.md`.
5. Add a test for the new accepted value; a level that exists only as a file is rejected by `retag` and by the guard.

Changing a level's rigor is a workflow change: ticket by ticket, `retag` is the supported way to move a ticket to another level, not editing the profile.

## Changing Complexity

If a ticket's complexity changes during development:

```bash
/workflow retag {ticket-number} {new-complexity}
```

This adjusts remaining steps to match the new complexity level.

## Quality Preservation

- **Bug**: Fast triage, regression test
- **Low**: Oneshot quality (minimal exploration, direct fix)
- **Medium**: Structured quality (planned, no adversarial review)
- **Complex**: Maximum rigor (deep analysis, adversarial review, comprehensive testing)
