# SaaSFoundryAI

CLI tool that scaffolds production-ready SaaS projects (NestJS + React + PostgreSQL + Docker).

## 🧭 Preconditions first (read before asking questions)

Before asking the user anything about scope, backend, or module choices, **read the manifest and check the configured tools**:

1. Read `.saasfoundry.json` — this is the source of truth for workflow, SRS backend, and installed modules. Never re-ask what is already declared there.
2. Run `sf status --claude-friendly --no-network` to get a summary of the manifest, installed modules, and preconditions. On a configured session this is also auto-injected via the `SessionStart` hook
   in `.claude/settings.json`.
3. Only surface scope questions for things that are **not** resolvable from the manifest (e.g. genuine product decisions). If a precondition is `fail`, route the user to the relevant install/config
   CLI (`sf workflow`, `sf skill install`, etc.) instead of asking scope questions.

This rule exists because AI sessions historically asked users to re-pick the SRS backend (notion/atlassian/local-markdown) and parent page even though both were already in the manifest — those answers
must come from `.saasfoundry.json`, not from a fresh dialogue.

## 🌐 Output language

Everything produced here — SRS pages, tickets and their comments, code comments, commit messages, docs — is written in the language declared in `.saasfoundry.json` → `language`, which is English on
all three surfaces (`srs`, `tickets`, `codeComments`).

**The language of the conversation is not the signal.** Sessions are often held in French; the artefacts stay English. `sf status --claude-friendly` prints the resolved values.

## 🚨 Critical Rules (non-negotiable)

**We are dogfooding our own system.** Users of SaaSFoundryAI will rely on their AI agents to follow the workflows we generate. If we don't follow ours rigorously, we can't guarantee the system works.

### Workflow — NEVER bypass

- **Statuses**: `Backlog → Ready → In progress → AI testing → Human testing → In review → Done`
- **Before any status transition**: read `.claude/skills/sf-workflow/statuses/<N>-<name>.md` for mandatory actions and exit conditions
- **Never skip statuses.** In particular: never go Backlog → AI Testing, never create a PR before Human Testing validation (unless ticket carries `nature:internal`), never mark Done before the PR is
  merged
- **Nature axis (Human Testing optionality)** — `nature:internal` tickets (refactor / scaffolding / non-terminal stories of an Epic) may transition AI Testing → In Review directly. Default (no label
  or `nature:user-facing`) requires Human Testing. The `update-status` guard enforces this — see `.claude/skills/sf-workflow/SKILL.md` "Nature axis" section.
- **Never bypass the CLI**: use `.claude/skills/sf-workflow/workflow-cli.sh` and `.claude/skills/sf-tool-github-projects/github-projects-cli.sh` — not raw `gh api graphql` mutations
- **Commit + push BEFORE moving to AI Testing.** Code must be on remote before any testing phase.
- **Subtasks must be real GitHub issues** (not checkboxes), created via `.claude/skills/sf-tool-github-projects/github-projects-cli.sh create-subtask`

### Migration framework — NEVER bypass

The migration framework (Epic #310) only delivers value if every breaking change runs through it. Inline shims in `sf update`, ad-hoc type mutations, and "the user can fix their manifest manually"
shortcuts reintroduce exactly the cross-version drift the framework was built to prevent.

- **Manifest shape changes** — Any breaking change to `SaaSFoundryManifest` (renaming a field, removing one, restructuring a sub-block) MUST ship as a numbered migration in
  `src/migrations/manifest/NNN-<name>.ts` with a registered entry in `src/migrations/manifest/index.ts`, a JSON-schema delta in `schemas/saasfoundry-manifest.schema.json`, and a golden fixture pair
  under `src/__tests__/unit/migrations/fixtures/NNN-<name>/`. Never mutate manifests inline in commands; never bump `manifestVersion` without registering a migration.
- **Module file-set changes** — Any breaking change to a module's installed file set (renaming a service file, splitting an installer's deposited files, requiring a new env var) MUST bump the
  installer's `currentVersion` in `<name>.installer.ts` AND ship a `ModuleMigration` on its `migrations` array. Use `writeMigratedFile` from `src/migrations/module/conflict.ts` so user-edited files
  fall back to a `.saasfoundry.new` sidecar.
- **Read the playbook first** — Before editing `src/types.ts`, `schemas/saasfoundry-manifest.schema.json`, any installer's deposited templates, or any file under `src/migrations/`, read
  `.claude/docs/migration-framework.md`. It covers the registry pattern, the file-naming convention, the conflict-aware writer, and worked examples for both manifest renames and module file splits.

### Reading before acting

- Workflow: `.claude/skills/sf-workflow/SKILL.md` and the `statuses/` files
- SRS drafting / spawning: `.claude/skills/sf-srs/SKILL.md`
- Integration grammar (adding modules / pages / endpoints): `.claude/skills/sf-integration-rules/SKILL.md`
- CLI orchestration (`sf new`, `sf update`, `sf workflow`, feedback flows): `.claude/skills/tool-saasfoundry/SKILL.md` — symlinked to `scaffolds/skills-templates/tool-saasfoundry/` so contributor
  edits land in the source of truth
- Module architecture (adding/modifying modules): `.claude/docs/architecture-modules.md`
- Skills architecture (adding/modifying skills): `.claude/docs/architecture-skills.md`
- Migration framework (any breaking manifest/module change): `.claude/docs/migration-framework.md`
- Workflow configuration: `.saasfoundry.json` (source of truth — never hardcode branch names, status names, etc.)

## Tech Stack

## CLI Commands

- `sf new` — Create a new SaaSFoundryAI project (src/commands/new.ts)
- `sf update` — Add modules to an existing project (src/commands/update.ts)
- `sf workflow` — Manage workflow configuration and AI rules (src/commands/workflow.ts)

### Dev Commands

- `npm run build` — Compile CLI
- `npm run dev` — Watch mode for CLI development
- `npm run format` — Prettier
- `npm run lint` — ESLint
- `npm run test:pre-commit` — Format + Lint + Type-check + Jest tests (runs on pre-commit, ~15s)
- `npm run test:pre-push` — Top 2 Docker scenarios (runs on pre-push for non-RC branches, ~2-3 min)
- `npm run test:full` — Alias: `test:pre-commit` + `test:pre-push` (full local validation)
- `npm run test:docker` — All Docker scenarios (~70 min; `test:docker:list` prints the current set, `--count` the number)
- `npm run test:docker -- --count N` — Top N priority scenarios
- `npm run test:docker -- --scenario <name>` — Single scenario
- `npm run test:docker:list` — Show all scenarios
- One of them, `multirepo-boot-and-test`, **starts** a generated project instead of compiling it — `sf new --start-services` against a Postgres inside the test image, then `/api/health` and the web
  root must answer, then `npm audit` and the api's own unit suite. It runs on PRs to both branches; the rest of the matrix compiles only (#594).

## Git Workflow

- Working branch: `develop`, release branch: `master` (see `.saasfoundry.json` → `workflow.workingBranch` / `releaseBranch`)
- **ALWAYS** use conventional commits: `<type>(#<ticket>): <description>`
- Types: feat, fix, docs, style, refactor, perf, test, chore, ci, build, revert
- Scope (ticket number) is required by commitlint
- Max header length: 100 characters
- Husky enforces commit format and pre-push checks
- RC branches (`rc-*`) trigger automated version management

## Code Conventions

### Backend (scaffolds/blueprints/api/)

- Module pattern: `module.ts`, `controller.ts`, `service.ts`, `dto/*.dto.ts`, `tests/unit/*.spec.ts`, `tests/e2e/*.spec.ts`
- Path aliases: `@modules/*`, `@common/*`, `@configs/*`, `@/*`
- Prisma multi-file schemas in `prisma/schema/`
- Validation with class-validator + class-transformer
- Logging with Winston (daily rotation)

### Frontend (scaffolds/blueprints/web/)

- Pages in `src/pages/private/` and `src/pages/public/`
- Lazy-loaded routes with code splitting
- API hooks in `src/hooks/api/`
- UI components in `src/components/ui/` (ShadCN)
- Translations in `src/locales/` (YAML format)
- Path alias: `@/*` → `./src/*`

## Docker

- Dev database: `docker-compose.db.yml` (port 5435 by default — `sf new` moves to the next free port and records the choice in `.saasfoundry.json` → `ports`, see #584)
- External network: `docker network create saasfoundry-network`
- API health check: `GET /api/health`
- Build tests: `Dockerfile.test` + `tests/docker/` — generates real projects and runs `npm install` + `tsc` + `nest build` + `vite build`

## Important Context

- This is a **scaffold/generator** CLI — the code in `scaffolds/` is template code, not application code
- **NEVER** modify scaffold templates without considering the impact on generated projects
- Current version: 1.0.0-beta (npm package `saasfoundryai-cli`)
- Node.js >= 22.13.0 to run the CLI (its own `.nvmrc` says 22.15.0)
- **The generated API and web app run different TypeScript majors, on purpose.** The API is pinned to **5.9.x** with `ignoreDeprecations: "5.0"`; the web app is on 6.x. NestJS 11's OpenAPI CLI plugin
  cannot read the TypeScript 6 AST — it emits `{ enum: string }`, a bare identifier with no runtime value, and **no generated API can start**. The compiler, the build and the unit suite all stay
  green, because the metadata is only invalid at runtime. See #595 for the measurement and #643 for what happened when the difference was mistaken for drift and "fixed". It stops being a constraint
  the day the backend moves to NestJS 12, which is an ESM migration — see `.claude/docs/embedded-dependencies.md`.
- **Generated projects ask for Node 24** — their `.nvmrc` says 24.19.0, because they declare `npm >= 11` with `onFail: error` and Node 22 ships npm 10. The CLI reads the target project's `.nvmrc`
  before shelling out to `npm`; it does not impose its own version. See #589 — the two used to be assumed identical, and every `npm run` in a generated project was refused.
