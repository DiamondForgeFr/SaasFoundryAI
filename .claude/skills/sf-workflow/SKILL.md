## 🎯 Complexity-Based Adaptive Workflow

This workflow adapts its rigor based on ticket complexity:

| Level       | Label      | Process                          | Use Case          |
| ----------- | ---------- | -------------------------------- | ----------------- |
| **bug**     | 🐛 Bug Fix | Direct fix, regression test      | Quick bug fixes   |
| **low**     | 🟢 Low     | Oneshot-style (minimal ceremony) | Simple tasks      |
| **medium**  | 🟡 Medium  | Apex-free-style (structured)     | Standard features |
| **complex** | 🔴 Complex | Full Apex (adversarial review)   | Critical features |

**Key principle:** Higher complexity = more rigor (analysis depth, planning detail, adversarial review, test coverage)

## 🎚️ Nature axis (user-facing vs internal)

Orthogonal to complexity. Controls whether **Human Testing** is mandatory or optional in the lifecycle.

| Label                | Use case                                                                                          | Workflow effect                                        |
| -------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------ |
| `nature:user-facing` | Bug fix or feature with visible UX impact — anything a user can click, see, or feel               | Mandatory `AI Testing → Human Testing → In Review`     |
| `nature:internal`    | Refactor, scaffolding, non-terminal story of a multi-step Epic, internal tooling, doc-only change | Optional `AI Testing → In Review` (skip Human Testing) |

**Default** — if a ticket has no `nature:*` label, the workflow treats it as `user-facing` (safe default).

**Why this exists** — the Human Testing status is theatrical on tickets that have nothing user-visible to validate (the docker tests + lint + tsc already cover the integration risk). For those, going
AI Testing → In Review directly removes ceremony without sacrificing safety.

**Epic-level Human Testing** — when an Epic is composed entirely of `nature:internal` children, the meaningful manual validation happens at **Epic completion** (e.g. integration test on freshly merged
`develop`), not on each child. Tag the Epic itself `nature:user-facing` so its own AI Testing → In Review transition still requires that integration check.

**Guard** — `update-status <ticket> "In review"` is rejected when the current status is `AI Testing` and the ticket lacks `nature:internal`. Fix by either tagging the ticket internal or going through
Human Testing first. Escape hatch: `SF_WORKFLOW_BYPASS_NATURE_GUARD=1` (rare).

## 🧩 Ticket Hierarchy (Epic / Story-Task / Subtask)

SaaSFoundry uses a **three-level ticket hierarchy** — Epics produce **no PR**, Subtasks are **not GitHub issues**.

```
(Epic)          optional grouper
 └─ Story|Task  mandatory — branch + PR + full workflow
     └─ Subtask optional — commit on the Story/Task branch
```

| Level           | Role                                                                            | Deliverable                                     | GitHub artifact                                                                          | Status                                     |
| --------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------ |
| **Epic**        | Grouper for related Stories/Tasks (SRS feature, bug batch, transverse refactor) | **None directly** — no branch, no commit, no PR | Issue with child Story/Task issues linked via `addSubIssue`                              | **Derived from children** (see rule below) |
| **Story**       | Delivers user-observable value                                                  | Branch + commits + PR                           | Regular issue, `story.tpl.ts` body — Acceptance Criteria section                         | Explicit, full 7-status lifecycle          |
| **Task**        | Delivers a technical action                                                     | Branch + commits + PR                           | Regular issue, `task.tpl.ts` body — Completion Criteria section                          | Explicit, full 7-status lifecycle          |
| **Issue (bug)** | Task variant for defects                                                        | Branch + commits + PR                           | Regular issue, `issue.tpl.ts` body — Behavior/Expected/Repro/Environment/Impact/Evidence | Explicit, full 7-status lifecycle          |
| **Subtask**     | Step in the action plan of a Story/Task                                         | A single commit (atomically revertible)         | **Never** an issue, **never** a branch, **never** a PR                                   | — (commit lands on parent branch)          |

**⚠️ Naming warning** — the `create-subtask` CLI misnames its output: it creates **Story tickets**, not true Subtasks. True Subtasks are commits and are not tracked on the board.

### Epic status derivation rule

An Epic's board status is **computed from its children**, never set directly.

| Direction                                                                 | Rule                                      | Intuition                                                                 |
| ------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Ascent** (Backlog → Ready → In progress)                                | Epic = **earliest** status among children | As soon as one child advances, the Epic moves with it                     |
| **Descent** (In progress → AI testing → Human testing → In review → Done) | Epic = **latest** status among children   | The Epic reaches a later stage only when **all** children have reached it |

**Consequence** — an Epic at `Done` is a strong contract: every child is merged. Example: children at `{In progress, Ready, Backlog}` ⇒ Epic = `Ready` (earliest). Children at
`{Done, In review, In review}` ⇒ Epic = `In review` (latest).

## How to use this skill

**FIRST TIME on a ticket:**

1. **Detect complexity:** `/workflow detect-complexity <ticket-number>`
2. **Confirm with developer:** AI suggests, developer decides
3. **Follow adaptive process:** Each status adapts to complexity level

**BEFORE EVERY ACTION:**

1. Invoke this skill with `/workflow status <ticket-number>`
2. Read the COMPLETE description of the current status
3. Follow EXACTLY the instructions from that description
4. Never guess - if uncertain, run `/workflow status` again

## Configuration (Source of Truth)

All workflow configuration lives in **`.saasfoundry.json`** at the project root. See [manifest schema](../../docs/manifest-schema.md) for the full field list and read snippets. **Never hardcode branch
names** — always read from the manifest.

## Available Commands

### Workflow Status Commands

**`/workflow status <ticket>`** Displays the current status of the ticket and loads the complete description of that status.

**`/workflow next <ticket>`** Indicates the next status and what needs to be done to get there.

**`/workflow validate <ticket>`** Checks if all conditions are met to move to the next status.

**`/workflow help`** Displays the list of statuses and their role.

### Complexity Commands (NEW)

**`/workflow detect-complexity <ticket>`** Auto-suggests complexity level based on:

- Number of files potentially impacted
- Keywords (auth, payment, security → complex)
- Risk assessment
- Historical patterns

Developer always has final say.

**`/workflow retag <ticket> <new-complexity>`** Changes ticket complexity level (bug | low | medium | complex). Adjusts remaining workflow steps to match new complexity.

**Guard** — `update-status <ticket> <target>` is rejected for any target other than `Backlog` if the ticket has no `complexity: *` label. `detect-complexity` only suggests — you must call `retag` to
persist. The guard fails open if label fetch errors (offline / auth issues). Escape hatch: `SF_WORKFLOW_BYPASS_COMPLEXITY_GUARD=1` (rare).

### Workflow Phase Commands (Complexity-Adaptive)

**`/workflow prepare <ticket> <complexity>`** — adaptive analyze + plan phase (Backlog → Ready). **`/workflow test <ticket> [complexity]`** — validation + optional adversarial review (→ AI Testing).

| Complexity  | `prepare` behavior                                | `test` behavior                                                    |
| ----------- | ------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **bug**     | Skip — direct to implementation                   | Validation only (build, lint, typecheck, unit tests)               |
| **low**     | Minimal — 2–3 files, mental plan                  | Validation only                                                    |
| **medium**  | Standard — 2–4 agents, detailed plan + approval   | Validation only                                                    |
| **complex** | Deep — 6–10 agents, comprehensive plan + approval | Validation **+ adversarial review** (security, logic, performance) |

## Tool-Specific Commands

Workflow commands that interact with your project management tool (GitHub Projects, Jira, Notion, Linear) are delegated to tool-specific CLIs.

The workflow skill automatically routes commands to the appropriate tool based on your `.saasfoundry.json` configuration.

**Example:** Creating a subtask

```bash
# This command is automatically routed to the correct tool
.claude/skills/sf-workflow/workflow-cli.sh create-subtask <parent> <title>
```

See your tool-specific skill documentation for complete command reference:

- GitHub Projects: `.claude/skills/sf-tool-github-projects/SKILL.md`
- Jira: `.claude/skills/sf-tool-jira/SKILL.md`
- Notion: `.claude/skills/sf-tool-notion/SKILL.md`
- Linear: `.claude/skills/sf-tool-linear/SKILL.md`

## SRS Handoff (drafting / spawning tickets)

When a ticket crosses into **Ready** and requires Software Requirements Specifications (US / UR / FR / DS / TC), stop and hand off to the agnostic SRS skill:

- `.claude/skills/sf-srs/SKILL.md` — selects the configured SRS backend from `.saasfoundry.json → tools.srs.backend`
- `.claude/skills/sf-srs/scripts/srs-cli.sh validate` — smoke-tests the backend adapter (init OK, exit 0)
- `.claude/skills/sf-srs/scripts/srs-cli.sh draft|spawn|eval` — backend-neutral actions (sibling SUBs under #174 fill the body)

Never bypass the skill to write SRS by hand — the backend dispatch is how new projects get to swap Notion for Confluence / local markdown without touching the workflow logic.

### Drafting lifecycle (tickets labelled `srs:drafting | srs:update | srs:new`)

SRS tickets don't flow through the code-path statuses — they have their own lifecycle inside the `In progress` board column:

```
Ready → In progress (brainstorm)
         → ai-draft        (srs-cli.sh draft)
         → human-review    (owner reviews the backend page)
         → spawning        (srs-cli.sh spawn — creates Backlog children)
         → done            (board status → Done)
```

Drive it with:

```bash
.claude/skills/sf-workflow/workflow-cli.sh transition-drafting <ticket> <phase>
# phase: ai-draft | human-review | spawning | done
```

Each phase is documented in detail:

- `statuses/3a-ai-drafting.md` — AI drafter runs against the configured backend
- `statuses/3b-human-review.md` — spec owner reviews and approves
- `statuses/3c-spawning.md` — children land in Backlog, drafting ticket closes

**Guard** — `update-status <ticket> "AI testing|Human testing|In review"` is rejected when the ticket carries an `srs:*` label. Use `transition-drafting` instead. The guard fails open if label fetch
errors (offline / auth issues) so normal teams are not punished by infrastructure hiccups.

### Rule 8 — spawning Stories from SRS

Once an Epic page tree is drafted (Main spec + FR-001…FR-N children), the Story sub-tickets under the parent must be created by the spawner, not by hand:

```bash
.claude/skills/sf-srs/scripts/srs-cli.sh spawn --ticket <parent> --epic <page-url-or-id>
```

The spawner enumerates FR pages, renders each Story body from `renderStoryTicketBody`, and invokes `workflow-cli.sh create-subtask` with `--bypass-srs spawned-from-srs`. Children land as regular
sub-issues under the parent ticket (no `srs:*` label — they flow through the normal code-path workflow). Use `--dry-run` to preview without writing.

On SRS-enabled projects (`tools.srs.backend` is set), `create-subtask` refuses calls without `--bypass-srs <reason>` and exits 2. The escape hatch is legitimate only for:

- Meta tickets that don't map to an FR page (SRS tooling, drafter refactors, eval polish)
- Bootstrapping an Epic's own SUBs during rollout before the page tree exists

Typing the reason is the audit trail — pick something a reviewer can grep for (`spawned-from-srs`, `meta-srs-tooling`, `bootstrap-epic-174`…). If the ticket represents a feature requirement, the
answer is always "go draft it first, then spawn."

### Conversational eval hook (SRS-enabled projects)

When `tools.srs.enabled = true`, Claude must interject during conversation turns whose content looks like a new User Requirement / Functional Requirement / Design decision / Test Case, propose a diff,
and on user accept apply it via `.claude/skills/sf-srs/scripts/srs-cli.sh apply-update`. The detection heuristics, confirmation flow, and scope limits (ADD-only in v1) live in the sf-srs SKILL.md —
see its `## Conversational eval hook (SUB-10)` section. This skill only references it ; never duplicate the heuristics here.

## Workflow Statuses

1. **Backlog** (GRAY) — Read `statuses/1-backlog.md` for full description
2. **Ready** (YELLOW) — Read `statuses/2-ready.md` for full description
3. **In progress** (BLUE) — Read `statuses/3-in-progress.md` for full description
4. **AI testing** (PURPLE) — Read `statuses/4-ai-testing.md` for full description
5. **Human testing** (ORANGE) — Read `statuses/5-human-testing.md` for full description
6. **In review** (PINK) — Read `statuses/6-in-review.md` for full description
7. **Done** (GREEN) — Read `statuses/7-done.md` for full description

**⚠️ This skill is your SOURCE OF TRUTH for the workflow.**

## Critical Rules

1. **ALWAYS read the status description** before taking any action
2. **NEVER skip steps** described in a status
3. **NEVER move to the next status** without meeting all exit conditions
4. **ASK if uncertain** - don't assume or guess
5. **CLOSE CHILD TICKETS AS THEY LAND** — after a child Story/Task/Issue's final commit is merged, immediately run `workflow-cli.sh update-status <child> Done` and verify
   `gh issue view <child> --json state` prints `CLOSED` before starting the next sibling. Never batch closures at the end of an Epic. (A true Subtask is a commit, not a GitHub issue — there is no
   status to close.)
6. **EPIC STATUS FOLLOWS CHILDREN** — an Epic's board status is derived from its children (earliest for ascent Backlog→In progress, latest for descent In progress→Done — see "Epic status derivation
   rule" above). Before advancing an Epic, run `gh issue list --state open --search "parent #<N>"` and confirm the target status is consistent with all children. An Epic can only reach `Done` when
   every child is `Done`.
7. **FINISH THE CURRENT TICKET BEFORE STARTING ANOTHER** — if a ticket is `In Progress` / `AI Testing` / `Human Testing` / `In Review`, drive it to `Done` before claiming or starting another. The only
   override is an explicit developer request to pause.
8. **TICKETS FROM SRS** — when `tools.srs.backend` is set in `.saasfoundry.json`, Story sub-tickets under an SRS Epic must be spawned from the canonical FR pages, not hand-written. Use
   `.claude/skills/sf-srs/scripts/srs-cli.sh spawn --ticket <parent> --epic <page-url-or-id>` to create one child issue per FR page, each body rendered from `renderStoryTicketBody`. The
   `create-subtask` command rejects any call without `--bypass-srs <reason>` on SRS-enabled projects — see the "SRS Handoff" section below. The escape hatch exists for meta tickets (SRS refactors,
   tooling) but must never be used to duplicate an FR that already has a page.

## Implementation

The status descriptions are in the `statuses/` directory:

- Each status has its own markdown file
- Descriptions include: when to enter, mandatory actions, exit conditions, next status
- The CLI script (`workflow-cli.sh`) queries the project management tool and displays the appropriate description
