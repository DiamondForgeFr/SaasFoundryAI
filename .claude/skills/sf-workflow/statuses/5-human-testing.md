# STATUS: Human Testing

Manual validation by the developer, followed by non-regression test creation.

## Applicability

This status is **mandatory for `nature:user-facing` tickets** (or any ticket without a `nature:*` label — safe default). It is **skipped for `nature:internal` tickets**, which transition AI Testing →
In Review directly. See SKILL.md "Nature axis" section.

## Ticket type

- **Epic** — no manual test, no PR. Status is **derived** from children (only enters Human Testing when the last child does). Skip this checklist. **Special case** — when the Epic groups exclusively
  `nature:internal` children, the meaningful manual validation happens at Epic completion (e.g. integration test on freshly merged `develop`); tag the Epic itself `nature:user-facing` so it visits
  this status.
- **Story / Task / Issue** — full flow below.

## Action checklist

- [ ] **Wait for validation** — developer tests manually, you stay available to answer
- [ ] **On bugs reported:**
  - Read the comments carefully, summarize the fix plan as a reply
  - Fix, commit, push, then return to **AI Testing** (re-run automated tests)
- [ ] **On approval** — create non-regression tests:
  - Complex/critical → E2E tests (Playwright)
  - Edge-case bug fix → unit non-regression test
  - Typo/doc/CSS refactor → none (state why in a comment)
- [ ] **Coverage** — main scenarios validated, edge cases identified, critical workflows
- [ ] **Verify locally** — `npm run test:e2e` (or relevant runner) must be green
- [ ] **Commit + push** — `test(#<N>): add E2E tests for <feature>` (pattern from `jq -r '.workflow.commitFormat.pattern' .saasfoundry.json`)

## Errors to avoid

- Creating tests BEFORE developer validation
- Creating a PR without non-regression coverage
- Pushing failing tests
